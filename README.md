# The Donut Hole
The static html/css front end for the web site of a donut store.

### This project relies on the following libraries:
- Bootstrap CSS
- Bootstrap JS, Popper.js, and jQuery
- FontAwesome
- Google Fonts

### Color Palette Credit
The color palette I began with was selected from Color Hunt (https://colorhunt.co/palette/178369), but almost all the colors have changed a little since implementing it.
